# 100 - Introduction

## A minimal SvelteKit site with Sanity Studio

This starter uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the frontend and [Sanity](https://sanity.io/) to handle its content.

Featuring

- How to fetch content as data from the Sanity Content Lake
- How to render block content with Portable Text
- A Sanity Studio to create and edit content
- How to crop and render images with Sanity Image URLs

**Note**: 

This starter features an /app and a /studio folder. The /app folder contains the frontend code, and the /studio folder contains the Sanity Studio code.

This is not a monorepo setup. We put them both in one repository for the sake of simplicity. You might want to have separate repositories for each of the folders, to make it easier to deploy the app and the studio separately.
