# 300 - Deployments

The ```/app``` and ```/studio``` folders are meant to be deployed separately.

Feel free to deploy the App to whichever hosting provider you prefer. We recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

You can deploy the Sanity Studio by running sanity deploy in the /studio repository, provided you have the ```@sanity/cli``` installed globally.
