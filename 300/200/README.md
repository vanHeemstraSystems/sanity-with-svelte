# 200 - Removing TypeScript

If you do not wish to use TypeScript, we've included a ```remove-typescript.mjs``` file in the root of this repository.

To run this file, you must:

1. Run ```npm install``` in the repository root to install dependencies
2. Run ```node remove-typescript.mjs``` to strip all types from both the ```/app``` and ```/studio``` folders

If you intend to use TypeScript or have stripped TypeScript, you can safely delete all files in the repository root that isn't ```/studio``` or ```/app```.
